## Hake Project

*hakeRead-0.001*  
*Released December, 2025* 

---

## TODO

- include *.css into Vignettes
- checking installed package size: sub-directories of 1Mb or more
- convert some R-functions to S3 Method

## Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/gggeom.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/gggeom)

*hakeRead* provides functions and structures for read outcomes from two stock assessment models for Southern Hake.

## Installation

*hakeRead* is not currently available on CRAN, but you can install it from github with:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("jcquiroz/hakeRead")
```

Note that since *hakeRead* makes extensive use of Rcpp for high-performance computations, you'll need a development environment with a C++ compiler.
